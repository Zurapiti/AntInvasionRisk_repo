# AntInvasionRisk_repo
this is a public repository of the code for alien species invasion risk analysis that tracks back the potential source of a species threat assemblage

This computational workflow predicts threats for a country or region of interest. Specifically: 
1) predicts which species are most likely to establish,
2) clusters areas of the country according to their predicted threat alien species assemblages and
3) finds regions of the globe that have concentrations of the species that threaten the focal country, which would indicate regions of threat.
